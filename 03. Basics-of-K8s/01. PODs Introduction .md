### ðŸ§© Step-01: PODs Introduction

#### ðŸ§  What is a POD?

* A **Pod** is the **smallest deployable unit** in Kubernetes.
* It represents **a single instance of a running process** in the cluster.
* A pod contains **one or more containers**, shared **storage (volumes)**, and **networking (IP, namespace)**.
* Every pod has its own **unique IP address** inside the cluster.

ðŸ“¦ **Key Points:**

* Pods are **ephemeral** â€” they can die and be recreated anytime.
* They are usually managed by higher controllers like **Deployments**, **ReplicaSets**, or **StatefulSets**.

#### ðŸ§© What is a Multi-Container Pod?

* A **multi-container pod** has **two or more containers** sharing the same **network and storage**.
* Containers inside a pod communicate via **localhost**.
* Common use case: sidecar patterns â€” like a main app container + logging or proxy container.

ðŸ§± **Example Use Cases:**

* Nginx + Fluentd (log collector)
* App + Prometheus exporter (metrics)
* App + sidecar authentication proxy

### ðŸ§© Step-02: PODs Demo

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-01: Get Worker Nodes Status

Verify Kubernetes worker nodes are ready.

```bash
# Configure kubeconfig for kubectl
gcloud container clusters get-credentials <CLUSTER-NAME> --region <REGION> --project <PROJECT-NAME>
gcloud container clusters get-credentials standard-public-cluster-1 --region us-central1 --project kdaida123

# Get Worker Node Status
kubectl get nodes

# Get Worker Node Status with wide option
kubectl get nodes -o wide
```

ðŸ“˜ **Sample Output:**

```
NAME                                        STATUS   ROLES    AGE   VERSION
gke-cluster-node-pool-1-abc123              Ready    <none>   21h   v1.29.2
gke-cluster-node-pool-1-def456              Ready    <none>   21h   v1.29.2
```

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-02: Create a Pod

```bash
# Template
kubectl run <desired-pod-name> --image <Container-Image>

# Example
kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0
```

ðŸ“˜ **Real Output:**

```
Pod/my-first-pod created
```

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-03: List Pods

```bash
# List Pods
kubectl get pods

# Alias for pods is 'po'
kubectl get po
```

ðŸ§¾ **Output Example:**

```
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
my-first-pod    1/1     Running   0          45s
```

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-04: List Pods with Wide Option

```bash
kubectl get pods -o wide
```

ðŸ“˜ **Output Example:**

```
NAME            READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE   IP           NODE
my-first-pod    1/1     Running   0          50s   10.4.2.7     gke-cluster-node-pool-1-abc123
```

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-05: What Happens in the Background?

When you run `kubectl run my-first-pod --image stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0`, Kubernetes does the following:

1. Creates a **Pod** object.
2. Pulls the Docker image from **Docker Hub**.
3. Creates a **container** inside the Pod.
4. Starts the container and assigns it an **internal IP**.

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-06: Describe Pod

Used mainly for **troubleshooting** and event tracking.

```bash
# Get Pod Name
kubectl get pods

# Describe Pod
kubectl describe pod <Pod-Name>
kubectl describe pod my-first-pod
```

ðŸ“˜ **Observation:**

1. Review **Events** â€” they show step-by-step pod lifecycle and any image pull errors or crashes.

ðŸ§¾ **Sample Output Snippet:**

```
Name:         my-first-pod
Namespace:    default
Status:       Running
Containers:
  kubenginx:
    Image: stacksimplify/kubenginx:1.0.0
    State: Running
Events:
  Normal  Scheduled  Pod scheduled successfully
  Normal  Pulled     Container image pulled
  Normal  Created    Created container
  Normal  Started    Started container
```

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-07: Access Application

* The app inside this pod is only **accessible within cluster nodes**.
* To make it available externally, you must create a **Service**.
* Kubernetes Services (NodePort or LoadBalancer) handle this exposure.

ðŸ§  **Key Concept:**

> Services are one of the most important objects in Kubernetes â€” they decouple access from pod lifecycle.

---

#### ðŸ§© Step-02-08: Delete Pod

```bash
# Get list of pods
kubectl get pods

# Delete Pod
kubectl delete pod <Pod-Name>
kubectl delete pod my-first-pod
```

ðŸ“˜ **Sample Output:**

```
pod "my-first-pod" deleted
```
